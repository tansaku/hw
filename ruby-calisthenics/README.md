Skeleton code and sanity specs for homework 1 (instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pSzxP02UyoC4z-fSOgEUOjfnPIe_2y4FlmpZuBGwx8/edit#heading=h.8xdtcqmc3evn)).

Skeleton Code
=============

The skeleton code for parts 1-7 are located in `skeleton_code/`.

Running Sanity Specs
====================

To run the sanity specs, please make sure `rspec` is installed.
To install rspec, run `gem install rspec`.
If you have your solution saved to a file located at `path/to/solution.rb`, and
the corresponding spec is located at `other_path/to/sanity_spec.rb`, then you can run
the sanity spec with:

    rspec path/to/solution.rb other_path/to/sanity_spec.rb

The output should look something like:

    ...

    Finished in 0.00206 seconds
    3 examples, 0 failures

Autograding
===========
Clone the Ruby Autograder and run `rag/grade <student's solution> <spec file>`.
